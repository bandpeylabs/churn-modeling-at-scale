# Churn Modeling at Scale - Databricks Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end churn modeling capabilities using Databricks, transforming raw behavioral logs into trusted insights, predictive services, and executive-caliber narratives that shape product and marketing strategy.

## Business Challenge

Recent signals suggest early churn—customers who cancel within their first 90 days—has quietly crept above forecast. Leadership needs a prototype that:

1. **Measures churn magnitude and seasonality**
2. **Predicts which active subscribers are at risk in the coming month**
3. **Explains the "why" in language that non-technical stakeholders understand**

## Project Architecture

The project follows a modern data lakehouse architecture with three layers:

```
Bronze (Raw Data) → Silver (Cleaned Features) → Gold (Insights & Predictions)
```

### Data Flow

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw Wikimedia pageviews + synthetic user behavior data
- **Silver Layer**: Processed features and engagement KPIs
- **Gold Layer**: Churn predictions, insights, and business metrics

## Notebook Structure

### 1. Environment Setup (`config/01_env_config.py`)

- Unity Catalog configuration
- Table and volume creation
- Environment variable setup
- MLflow experiment configuration

### 2. Data Ingestion (`01-wikimedia-ingestion.py`)

- Wikimedia pageview data ingestion
- Data quality analysis and validation
- Bronze layer storage with Delta Lake

### 3. Data Exploration (`02-data-exploration.py`)

- Wikimedia data pattern analysis
- Synthetic user behavior data generation
- Data quality assessment and quirk identification
- Seasonality and temporal pattern analysis

### 4. Feature Engineering (`03-feature-engineering.py`)

- Engagement KPI computation (DAU/WAU/MAU)
- Behavioral pattern feature creation
- Subscription lifecycle features
- Comprehensive feature matrix preparation

### 5. Churn Modeling (`04-churn-modeling.py`)

- Multiple algorithm training (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression)
- Hyperparameter optimization with cross-validation
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Feature importance analysis
- Model deployment and prediction generation

### 6. Dashboard & BI (`05-dashboard-bi.py`)

- Executive summary dashboard queries
- Churn funnel and retention analysis
- Cohort heatmap visualization
- Risk scoring and model insights
- Business intelligence recommendations

## Key Features

## Technical Implementation

### Spark Best Practices

- Delta Lake for ACID transactions
- Efficient partitioning strategies
- Native Spark ML pipeline integration
- Memory-optimized data processing

### Model Performance

- **Random Forest**: Best performing algorithm after hyperparameter tuning
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV ensures robust evaluation
- **Metrics**: ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, accuracy, precision, recall
- **Production Ready**: Automated model deployment and prediction generation

### Data Engineering

- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles large-scale user behavior data
- **Real-time Capable**: Designed for streaming data integration
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive data validation and monitoring

## Business Insights

### Key Findings

1. **Feature Adoption Impact**: Users with 0-1 features have 3.2x higher churn rate
2. **Early Stage Risk**: 0-90 day subscribers account for 65% of total churns
3. **Plan Type Sensitivity**: Basic plan users churn 2.1x more than enterprise users
4. **Geographic Patterns**: APAC region shows 15% higher churn than US/EU markets

### Actionable Recommendations

- Implement onboarding programs and feature discovery campaigns
- Focus retention efforts on new customer success programs
- Review pricing strategy for basic plans
- Investigate cultural and localization factors for international markets

## Dashboard Integration

The project provides comprehensive SQL queries for interactive dashboard creation:

- **Executive Summary**: KPI cards with color-coded status indicators
- **Churn Funnel**: Subscription lifecycle stages with retention rates
- **Cohort Analysis**: Monthly cohorts with survival rate heatmaps
- **Risk Scoring**: Predicted churn risk by user segments
- **Feature Analysis**: Feature adoption impact on retention
- **Geographic Insights**: Regional churn patterns with drill-down capabilities
